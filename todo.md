- [ ] Write an actual README
- [ ] Maybe remove SSL certs from containers? It shouldn't be needed, since Nginx is proxying.
- [X] GET params should be encoded in base64 for /client
- [ ] Implement clipboard transfer
- [ ] Client should have better streaming quality
- [ ] Add file transfer
- [ ] Add a toolbar of some sort
